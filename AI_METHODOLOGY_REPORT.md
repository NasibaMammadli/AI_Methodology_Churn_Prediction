  - Contract payment interaction: -0.0530 (reducing churn risk)
  - Contract risk: -0.0492 (reducing churn risk)
  - Monthly charges: +0.0441 (increasing churn risk)

**Interpretation:**
This customer has a very low churn risk due to favorable contract terms and payment arrangements, despite having relatively high monthly charges.

### 3.4 Feature Interaction Analysis
